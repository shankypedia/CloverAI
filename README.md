# CloverAI: AI Governance Framework

CloverAI is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure ethical AI deployment in cloud environments. It provides automated governance, bias detection, privacy protection, and compliance monitoring for organizations deploying AI systems at scale.

## Core Capabilities

The framework addresses critical challenges in AI governance through several integrated modules:

### Bias Detection and Mitigation
Our framework employs advanced fairness metrics to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems. It supports both general and domain-specific analysis, with specialized metrics for healthcare and financial services sectors. The system automatically detects potential biases across protected attributes and provides actionable mitigation strategies.

### Privacy Protection
CloverAI implements robust privacy protection measures including data encryption, anonymization, and differential privacy techniques. The framework ensures compliance with major privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, providing comprehensive audit trails and data protection verification.

### Governance Automation
The framework automates policy enforcement through integration with Kubernetes, ensuring that AI systems operate within defined governance parameters. It provides real-time monitoring of compliance metrics and automated policy enforcement across cloud environments.

### Real-Time Monitoring
Continuous monitoring capabilities track key metrics related to bias, privacy, and governance compliance. The system generates alerts for potential violations and provides detailed analytics for governance oversight.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shankypedia/CloverAI.git
   cd CloverAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your environment:
   ```bash
   cp config/example.yaml config/config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your settings
   ```

### Basic Usage
Run the framework with default settings:
```bash
python main.py
```

For custom configurations:
```bash
python main.py --config path/to/config.yaml
```

## Architecture

CloverAI follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and extensibility:

- **Input Layer**: Handles data ingestion and initial validation
- **Processing Layer**: Manages bias detection, privacy protection, and governance enforcement
- **Monitoring Layer**: Provides real-time metrics and compliance tracking
- **Reporting Layer**: Generates comprehensive governance reports and audit trails

## Configuration

The framework can be configured through YAML files in the `config` directory. Key configuration areas include:

- Bias detection thresholds and protected attributes
- Privacy protection levels and encryption settings
- Governance policies and compliance rules
- Monitoring parameters and alert thresholds
